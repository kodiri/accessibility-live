          <h2>Coach travel</h2>
          <img class="content-right" src="http://www.transportforall.org.uk/media_assets/uploads/coaches.jpg" alt="Coach" />

          <p>Coach travel can be a cheaper alternative to trains for getting around the UK. The accessibility regulations governing coaches (PSVAR regulations) do not come into force until 2020,
            so many coaches in the UK remain inaccessible to wheelchair users.</p>

          <p>In addition, many coach stops in the UK remain inaccessible to coach users, for example, because street furniture blocks a wheelchair lift from operating.
            So it is worth contacting the coach company before you travel to check if your planned route includes accessible stops.</p>

          <p>Access polices of the largest coach companies operating in London: </p>

          <h1>National Express</h1>

          <p>Most of coaches in National Express’s fleet have a wheelchair lift. However, many wheelchair models do not fit in their ‘accessible’ coaches.
            Thus, you are advised to contact the assisted travel helpline 36 hours in advance of travel with the size,
            make and model of your chair to ensure that your wheelchair fits into the wheelchair space. Call National Express on: 0371 781 8181 </p>

          <p>If you are a scooter user, National Express will not allow you to travel in your scooter. They only accept small lightweight mobility scooters for storage and carriage in the coach luggage hold.
              Again, call the National Express on the number above to find out more or visit their Mobility Scooter Page on their website.</p>

          <p>Regrettably, National Express Coaches have no audio visual information given throughout the journey so ask the driver to announce when you are approaching your destination.
            He or she will also announce any rest breaks during the journey.</p>

          <p>More Information can be found at: <a href="http://www.nationalexpress.com/help-and-advice/about-us/disabled-travellers.aspx">National Express Disabled Travellers</a></p>

          <h3>Oxford Tube</h3>

          <p>The Oxford – London tube service has 26 low floor buses which are accessible to wheelchair users by a ramp at the back of the coach.
            There is only space for one wheelchair user per coach so if it is already being used you will need to wait for the next one. Coaches run every 10 minutes,
            24 hours a day and there is no need to book assistance in advance, just turn up and the driver should be able to help you.</p>

          <p>All coaches have an audio announcement when the coach leaves Oxford or London but the driver will announce all other stops over the radio.</p>
