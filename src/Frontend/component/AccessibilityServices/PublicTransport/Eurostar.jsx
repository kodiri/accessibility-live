          <p>Eurostar is a high-speed railway service connecting London with Amsterdam, Avignon, Brussels, Bourg-Saint-Maurice, Disneyland Paris, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Paris, and Rotterdam.
            All its trains traverse the Channel Tunnel between the United Kingdom and France, owned and operated separately by Getlink.</p>

          <p>The service is operated by eighteen-car Class 373/1 trains and sixteen-car Class 374 trains which run at up to 320 kilometres per hour (199 mph) on a network of high-speed lines.
            The LGV Nord line in France opened before Eurostar services began in 1994, and newer lines enabling faster journeys were added later—HSL 1 in Belgium and High Speed 1 in southern England.</p>
