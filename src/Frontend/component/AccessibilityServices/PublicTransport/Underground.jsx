          <p>Currently only 70 out of 270 Tube stations have some degree of step-free access. Manual boarding ramps at certain stations and interchanges provide additional step free access.
            Some improvements are planned for the next five years but there’s still a long way to go before the Underground system is fully accessible.</p>

          <h1>Tube Map</h1>

          <p>Out of the 70 step-free stations, only around half are step-free from the platform on to the train. The step-free access may be from a raised platform section, level with the floor of the train,
            or via a manual boarding ramp – see below for a list of Tube stations with manual boarding ramps. On the <a href="https://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/standard-tube-map.pdf">TfL Tube Map</a>,
            stations marked with a white wheelchair symbol are step-free to platform, but may have a gap or step to the train. 
            Stations marked with a blue wheelchair symbol are step-free from street right onto the train.</p>

          <p>TfL have also released a new Tube map showing routes you can take to avoid areas with large stretches of tunnels. 
            It’s particularly useful for people with claustrophobia or anxiety: <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/tube-map-with-tunnels.pdf">Download</a></p>
