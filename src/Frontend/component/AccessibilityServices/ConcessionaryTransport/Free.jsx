                    <h3>Older persons Freedom Pass – How to Apply </h3>

                    <p>If you were 60 or over on 6th April 2010 you are automatically entitled to a Freedom Pass.
              You can apply online here: <a href="https://secure.freedompass.org/account/apply"> Website</a>, or pick up the form at local libraries and council customer service centres
              (Please note that it’s no longer possible to apply for a Freedom Pass at the Post Office).</p>

                    <p>Please make sure you do not use photocopies of application forms as each from contains a barcode and a unique number which is used to track individual applications.</p>

                    <p>If you live in Camden you need to phone 020 7974 6435 / 5919 to apply directly to the Council. You will be asked to provide an email address.

                    <p>Due to the rise in the state pension age, you are no longer automatically entitled to a Freedom Pass on your 60th birthday. The age of eligibility will rise incrementally between 2010 and 2020.
              The earliest age for men and women to get concessionary travel passes will therefore rise gradually, from 60 on 6 April 2010 to 65 on 5 April 2020.</p>
