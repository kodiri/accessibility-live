            Passengers with disabiities are very important passengers who require accurate
            information when planning their journey. Currently, people with a disability are not
            able to determine whether key facilities, such as a lift, are functioning at a certain
            station. Neither are they able to know if the stations they plan to use are busy.Thus,
            Accessibility live is a website where pertinent information that is useful to such
            important passengers will be readily available.
